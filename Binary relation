The **Cartesian product** of sets is **not associative** because the resulting sets from different groupings of products are **not the same**, even though they might appear similar at first glance. Let’s break it down to see why:

---

### 🧩 **What is a Cartesian product?**

For two sets \( A \) and \( B \), the Cartesian product \( A \times B \) is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from \( A \) and the second element is from \( B \):

\[
A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\}
\]

For example:

- \( A = \{1, 2\} \)
- \( B = \{x, y\} \)

Then:

\[
A \times B = \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\}
\]

---

### 🚨 **What does associativity mean?**

An operation \( \circ \) is **associative** if:

\[
(A \circ B) \circ C = A \circ (B \circ C)
\]

---

### ⚡ **Why isn't the Cartesian product associative?**

Let’s test associativity for three sets \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):

- \( A = \{1\} \)
- \( B = \{x\} \)
- \( C = \{\alpha\} \)

---

#### 🔴 **Left-hand side: \((A \times B) \times C\)**

First, compute \( A \times B \):

\[
A \times B = \{(1, x)\}
\]

Now, compute \((A \times B) \times C\):

\[
(A \times B) \times C = \{((1, x), \alpha)\}
\]

The result is a set of **ordered pairs** where the first element is a pair, and the second element is from \( C \).

---

#### 🔵 **Right-hand side: \(A \times (B \times C)\)**

First, compute \( B \times C \):

\[
B \times C = \{(x, \alpha)\}
\]

Now, compute \( A \times (B \times C) \):

\[
A \times (B \times C) = \{(1, (x, \alpha))\}
\]

The result is a set of **ordered pairs** where the first element is from \( A \), and the second element is a pair.

---

### 🤯 **Comparing the results**

- \((A \times B) \times C = \{((1, x), \alpha)\}\)
- \(A \times (B \times C) = \{(1, (x, \alpha))\}\)

These two sets are **not equal** because the elements have **different structures**:

- \((A \times B) \times C\) contains a pair where the first element is itself a pair.
- \(A \times (B \times C)\) contains a pair where the second element is a pair.

---

### 🚫 **Conclusion: No associativity!**

Since \((A \times B) \times C \neq A \times (B \times C)\), the Cartesian product is **not associative**.
